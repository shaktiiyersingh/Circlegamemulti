This is a focus enhancing one screen game that allows the player to spend about 10 quick plays over 2 minutes, and get back a sharpened sense of focus that would be beneficial to any time of the day.
Every game play begins with the player clicking on the rectangular game play area.
On clicking, there are two circles, one moving from a min radius to max, and the other moving from a max radius to min at the same time. 
A touch or click in the rectangular area would stop the moving circles. At the point of stopping, the difference in radii is calculated and is directly proportional to the game play score.
A moving average score over the last ten plays is calculated (Moving average(n) if n < 10, Moving Average(10) if n > 10). The player must aim at consistently maintaining a certain number and getting better over time.
This score would be shown as a graph over the playing history.
Currently, in the process of implementing multi user logins, average score display, graphs and color scheme customization.
